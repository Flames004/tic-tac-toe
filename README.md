# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to play against each other in the classic Tic Tac Toe grid.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The game board will appear with a 3x3 grid.
3. Player 1 will be represented by "X" and Player 2 by "O."
4. The first player starts by clicking on an empty cell to place their symbol "X."
5. Then, the second player clicks on another empty cell to place their symbol "O."
6. Players take turns until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.
7. The game will automatically detect the winner or a draw and display the result.
8. To play again, click the "Restart" button.
